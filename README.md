# Libetpan-email-client
E-mail client based on the libetpan library. Written in C++.

The user inferface is not my own work - it is based on the FinalCut library and the implementation 
written by Holger Pirk @ Imperial College London.

Run these commands to get started...

cd MailPunk/
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ..
cmake --build .

It then runs for a while to compile the dependencies.

Run the executable MailPunk in the build directory to run the programme!
